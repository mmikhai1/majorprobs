                    <h3>Story</h3>
                    <blockquote>When Iqra Shaikh was fresh out of high school and she had no clue as to what she wanted to do. Every class opened up a whole new world and she would seriously consider majoring in whatever subject she was exploring at that time. For each major, she would do her due diligence and spent hours were spent surfing the internet to glean whatever information she could. 10-15 tabs were open as she researched the each major, potential career paths, the skills she could gain, and why that was the major for her. After going through this process multiple times, she realized that there has got to be a better way to do this. That was in 2012. After graduating, she decided to pursue the project and dedicate her life to Major Probs. The rest is history.</blockquote>
