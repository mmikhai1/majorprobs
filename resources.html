We realized that quite often, people don’t know much about their career options, and how to change or advance their career. While we tried our best to mentor them, it was frustrating to know that there were still millions of people out there who we couldn’t help.</p>
                                        <p>And then we noticed something else: The internet can answer almost any of our questions today – how to build a house, how to buy a car, or how to find love. But even though choosing a career is one of the most important decisions of our life, there is very little reliable guidance available online.</p>
                                        <p>This is why we decided to build a platform that gives everybody the tools to find the career that is right for them.</p>
                                        <p>We gathered experts in the fields of technology, marketing, and engineering who were passionate about improving career outcomes for everyone. And finally, in May 2015, we founded Zippia. We believe that everyone should be able to make career decisions with their eyes wide open. That’s why we’ve built the most intelligent and personalized resource for your career questions."</p>

We work hand-in-hand with the best, most trusted names in private student lending to offer help in finding the money students and their families need for college. In this challenging economy, many lenders have either discontinued offering student loans or have tightened up their restrictions on college loans. Some lenders can’t even lend in some states. Our website shares over 20 different loan options with students and colleges.</p>
                                        <p>TuitionChart does not make loans. Our website is a student loan solution that partners with lenders and works with many well-known colleges and universities to provide custom loan support. Universities, educational institutions, and lenders can even customize TuitionChart to fit their individual corporate needs.</p>

Sometimes it’s difficult to compare the features of each loan institution in an apples-to-apples way. The choices seem endless. How does a student know what choice is the right choice? TuitionChart is designed to help students and students’ families wend their way through the maze of financial aid information and help them act upon the information they receive.</p>
                                        <p>TuitionChart offers an amazing array of features to college students and their families. Through use of comparison tools and loan searches, all of the research is done for the student and the student’s family and they are partnered with the lenders that fit their specific needs. Lending needs are quickly analyzed according to how much large a loan is needed, the school and degree program in question, and the state in which the student lives. Because TuitionChart is always on top of what’s going on in the lending industry, all of the information given to students will always be correct and up-to-the-minute.</p>
                                        <p>TuitionChart has access to extremely accurate up-to-date information from each lender so that lenders will not only be screened according to students’ needs, but students can easily compare student loans offers. This site is simple for students and parents to navigate but behind the scenes, all of the numbers are being crunched for them so that students will get the absolute best results for their needs.</p>
                                        <p>Once students receive a list of Best Lenders from their loan results page they can pick the institutions that seem to best fit their needs and the needs of their family. Simply click on the apply button and you will be sent to the lender’s loan application. The lender will be happy to work with students to supply any information they need and will also help students to fill out their loan applications.</p>
                                        <p>When a student loan is needed, TuitionChart is always there to make loan decisions and applications worry-free.

Students will learn about the CSU requirements, tests, and application deadlines. The ""Explore Campuses"" tab allows students to determine which campus is best for them based on interests and needs. The ""Apply Online"" tab is the standard CSU application process that all campuses use for admission. Students must submit this online application during the announced application filing periods in order to be considered for admission to the campus of their choice. Once a student submits an application, campuses communicate with the student directly and inform them of upcoming deadlines. The ""Financial Aid"" tab describes the different types of financial aid available and provides students with information on how to apply for aid. Students wishing to be considered for aid must fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid by March 2.</p>
                                        <p>CSUMentor is free to use. The student will only pay the application fee charged by the CSU campus when an application for admission is submitted. All personal data entered by the user is not released without the user's express consent, and data entered in a planner can be transferred easily to an online application for admission.

                                        <p>"The University of California opened its doors in 1869 with just 10 faculty members and 38 students. Today, the UC system includes more than 238,000 students and more than 190,000 faculty and staff, with more than 1.7 million alumni living and working around the world.</p>
                                        <p>For almost 150 years, UC has expanded the horizons of what we know about ourselves and our world. Our campuses are routinely ranked among the best in the world, but our reach extends beyond campus borders.</p>
                                        <p>Our students, faculty, staff and alumni exchange ideas, make advancements and unlock the secrets and mysteries of the universe every day. They engage with their local governments, serve California schools, protect the environment and push the boundaries of space.</p>
                                        <p>Education and research as pioneering as California itself</p>
                                        <p>From all backgrounds, ethnicities and incomes, UC attracts the best and brightest. UC undergraduates come from all over California, and they work hard to make it to college. In fact, over 40 percent of UC students come from low-income families.</p>
                                        <p>UC's faculty are the drivers behind innovations in biotechnology, computer science, art and architecture — and they bring that knowledge, that greatness, directly to the classroom.</p>
                                        <p>Thousands of California jobs, billions of dollars in revenues, and countless everyday household items — from more plentiful fruits and vegetables to compact fluorescent light bulbs — can be traced back to UC discoveries. Similarly, many of the state’s leading businesses are based on UC technology, founded by our faculty or led by UC graduates.</p>
                                        <p>UC is a part of your life, every day</p>
                                        <p>Besides world-class classrooms and labs, UC has dozens of museums, concert halls, art galleries, botanical gardens, observatories and marine centers — academic resources, but also exciting gathering places for the community. Another half million people benefit from UC Extension’s continuing education courses and from Cooperative Extension’s agricultural advice and educational programs located throughout the state." </p>

                                        <p>"ASSIST is a computerized student-transfer information system that can be accessed over the World Wide Web. It displays reports of how course credits earned at one California college or university can be applied when transferred to another. ASSIST is the official repository of articulation for California’s colleges and universities and therefore provides the most accurate and up-to-date information available about student transfer in California.</p>
                                        <p>The ASSIST acronym stands for Articulation System Stimulating Interinstitutional Student Transfer.</p>
                                        <p>ASSIST Mission Our mission is to facilitate the transfer of California Community College students to California's public four-year universities by providing an electronic system for academic planning which delivers accurate, timely, and complete information and operates as the official repository of articulation information for the state of California.</p>
                                        <p>History of ASSIST In 1985, the University of California began to explore using computers to store, maintain, and display transfer-related data. With funding from the California State Legislature, ASSIST was created under the guidance and counsel of the three California postsecondary educational segments: the University of California, the California State Universities, and the California Community Colleges. The goal was to use the computer to provide students and counselors with an easy way to access accurate and complete information about transferring from one California college or university to another. The initial project, with a small number of colleges and universities participating, was evaluated and approved. Since that time, ASSIST has grown to include information about all of the public postsecondary educational institutions in California. In addition, it is the official repository of articulation information for California’s public colleges and universities.</p>
                                        <p>Funding and Management ASSIST is funded by the California state legislature. The ASSIST Board of Directors, made up of representatives from each of the public postsecondary educational segments, oversees development and establishes policy for ASSIST. The daily implementation and project operations are managed by the ASSIST Coordination Site. The Board of Directors and the ASSIST Coordination Site work together with participating campuses to ensure that ASSIST continues to meet the needs of students transferring among California’s institutions of higher education."</p>

                                        <p>Praised by admissions counselors, students, policymakers, and consumer groups, U-CAN consists of hundreds of institutional profiles featuring comparable data and links to qualitative campus information.

                                        <p>Through focus groups, students and parents told us the information they most need to make an informed college choice. Their comments shaped the format and content of the consumer information template, which includes comparable institutional data, and provides many targeted links to the institution's Web site for more detailed information on specific aspects of the institution. U-CAN is totally free - both to users and to the colleges and universities that choose to participate.</p>
                                        <p>U-CAN profiles also include information identified by policymakers as important for accountability. Congress and the U.S. Department of Education have called for more consumer information to help the public evaluate and choose colleges - a goal that NAICU strongly supports.</p>
                                        <p>The in-depth information included in the institutional profiles includes admissions, enrollment, academics, student demographics, graduation rates, most common fields of study, transfer of credit policy, accreditation, faculty information, class size, tuition and fee trends, price of attendance, financial aid, campus housing, student life, and campus safety.</p>
                                        <p>Through U-CAN, consumers have easy access to information on net tuition, average loan debt at graduation, and undergraduate class-size for hundreds of colleges. This information is generally difficult for consumers to find and comes from the U.S. Department of Education's IPEDS survey and the Common Data Set.</p>
                                        <p>Consumers also are able to search institutions by a wide array of variables, including tuition, debt at graduation, number of students, graduation rate, city, state, distance from home, affiliation, and more. And U-CAN's ""Planning to Go"" page offers links to key resources on how to prepare for college, find the best fit, and navigate the admissions and financial aid processes.</p>
                                        <p>NAICU created and manages U-CAN in close consultation with the National Association of Independent College and University State Executives, member presidents, and a number of other associations representing independent institutions. Participation by NAICU member institutions is voluntary, and private colleges do not have to be members of NAICU in order to participate.</p>
                                        <p>U-CAN is one of many consumer information tools available to prospective students and their parents. More information resources mean better educated consumers and, ultimately, more successful college students."</p>
